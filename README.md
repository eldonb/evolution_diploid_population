Evolution of a diploid population evolving under a form of viability selection and (optionally) sweepstakes reproduction

# example excursion

An example excursion for N=500, i.e.\ 1000 diploid individuals or 2000 allele copies at a single locus; with  strong selection (s=10), 
and Wright-Fisher equivalent evolution. Shown are 3 examples of excursion to fixation of the beneficial type starting in a single copy.
